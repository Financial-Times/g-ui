        <p>...the defense of the English language implies more than this, and perhaps it is best to start
        by saying what it does <em>not</em> imply.</p>
        <h2 class="crosshead">Cross head</h2>
        <p>To begin with it has nothing to do with archaism, with the salvaging of
        obsolete words and turns of speech, or with the setting up of a "standard
        English" which must never be departed from. On the contrary, it is
        especially concerned with the scrapping of every word or idiom which has
        outworn its usefulness. It has nothing to do with correct grammar and syntax,
        which are of no importance so long as one makes one's meaning clear, or with
        the avoidance of Americanisms, or with having what is called a "good prose
        style." On the other hand, it is not concerned with fake simplicity and
        the attempt to make written English colloquial. Nor does it even imply in every
        case preferring the Saxon word to the Latin one, though it does imply using the
        fewest and shortest words that will cover one's meaning. What is above all
        needed is to let the meaning choose the word, and not the other way around. In
        prose, the worst thing one can do with words is surrender to them. When you
        think of a concrete object, you think wordlessly, and then, if you want to
        describe the thing you have been visualizing you probably hunt about until you
        find the exact words that seem to fit it. When you think of something abstract
        you are more inclined to use words from the start, and unless you make a
        conscious effort to prevent it, the existing dialect will come rushing in and
        do the job for you, at the expense of blurring or even changing your meaning.
        Probably it is better to put off using words as long as possible and get one's
        meaning as clear as one can through pictures and sensations. Afterward one can
        choose -- not simply <em>accept</em> -- the phrases that will best cover the
        meaning, and then switch round and decide what impressions one's words are
        likely to make on another person. This last effort of the mind cuts out all
        stale or mixed images, all prefabricated phrases, needless repetitions, and
        humbug and vagueness generally. But one can often be in doubt about the effect
        of a word or a phrase, and one needs rules that one
        can rely on when instinct fails. I think the following rules will cover most
        cases: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.</li>
          <li>Never use a long word where a short one will do.</li>
          <li>If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.</li>
          <li>Never use the passive where you can use the active.</li>
          <li>Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.</li>
          <li>Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These rules sound elementary, and so they are, but they demand a deep change
        of attitude in anyone who has grown used to writing in the style now
        fashionable. One could keep all of them and still write bad English, but one
        could not write the kind of stuff that I quoted in those five specimens at the
        beginning of this article. </p>

        <p>I have not here been considering the literary use of language, but merely
        language as an instrument for expressing and not for concealing or preventing
        thought. Stuart Chase and others have come near to claiming that all abstract
        words are meaningless, and have used this as a pretext for advocating a kind of
        political quietism. Since you don't know what Fascism is, how can you struggle
        against Fascism? One need not swallow such absurdities as this, but one ought
        to recognize that the present political chaos is connected with the decay of
        language, and that one can probably bring about some improvement by starting at
        the verbal end. If you simplify your English, you are freed from the worst
        follies of orthodoxy. You cannot speak any of the necessary dialects, and when
        you make a stupid remark its stupidity will be obvious, even to yourself.
        Political language -- and with variations this is true of all political
        parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists -- is designed to make lies sound
        truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure
        wind. One cannot change this all in a moment, but one can at least change one's
        own habits, and from time to time one can even, if one jeers loudly enough,
        send some worn-out and useless phrase -- some <em>jackboot, Achilles' heel,
        hotbed, melting pot, acid test, veritable inferno</em>, or other lump of verbal
        refuse -- into the dustbin, where it belongs.</p>
